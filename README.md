2024 NFL Quarterback Composite Ratings

This repo/script builds a composite rating for NFL QBs by combining a mixed-effects model of situational performance (from nflfastR play-by-play) with context and intangible adjustments you provide (cold weather, opponent strength, consensus ranking, leadership, etc.). It outputs a polished GT table and saves it as a PNG.
